## 🎯 Project Goal (Why This EDA?)

In Machine Learning, **strong EDA decides model success**.

> **Objective:**  
> Perform **Step-1 of the ML pipeline — Visual Data Understanding** to uncover churn patterns, risk segments, and business drivers using **only data visualization**.

# This project was started as part of my **Skill Union Data Science Internship**.

---

##  What I Did in Step-1 (EDA Scope)

- Analyzed **churn distribution & imbalance**  
- Studied **demographics** (gender, senior citizens)  
- Explored **service usage behaviour** (Internet, Phone, Multiple Lines)  
- Compared **SIM operators** (Jio, Airtel, BSNL, Vi)  
- Evaluated **contract types & retention**  
- Investigated **billing & payment methods**  
- Performed **tenure-based churn analysis**  
- Analysed **monthly charges vs churn risk**

# All insights were derived through **clear, business-focused visualizations**.

---

##  Key Insights (What the Data Revealed)

 **Strong churn drivers**
- Month-to-month contracts  
- High monthly charges  
- Early customer tenure (0–18 months)

 **High-risk segments**
- Senior citizens  
- Customers without value-added services  
- Paperless billing users with low loyalty

 **Service & operator patterns**
- Fiber-optic users churn more despite premium plans  
- Multiple-line users show better retention  
- Operator policies impact churn more than gender

---

## 🎯 Business Takeaways

~ Retention improves with **long-term contracts**  
~ Pricing must align with **perceived value**  
~ Early-tenure experience is **critical**  
~ Bundling support & security services can **reduce churn**

---

## 🧠 ML Readiness After EDA

~ Class imbalance identified  
~ Categorical features mapped for encoding  
~ Skewed numerical features detected  
~ Clear feature-engineering opportunities found  

! Dataset is **ready for preprocessing & modeling**

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas & NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
